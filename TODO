ASSERT vs ASSERT_ERRNO_AND_EXIT
-------------------------------
Internal kernel functions should have ASSERT
Syscall function should have ASSERT_ERRNO_AND_EXIT

Parameters should be checked on both k* and sys__* functions,
on k* with ASSERT and on sys__* with ASSERT_ERRNO_AND_EXIT.

k* function can be called from sys__* (when same parameters are checked twice),
but also from other k* functions (thats why k* functions must have ASSERT).

---
create kernel thread? priv. thread?
=> NO privileged thread, just thread with give access to whole physical address
   space, like idle thread (in "kernel_proc" process)

projects on:
- security safe upgrade
- error checking and returns on errors (such as "no memory" for even descriptor)
- const, restrict keywords..., static
